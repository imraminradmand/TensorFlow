# Cancer Model

 Model predicts the likeliness of breast cancer based on the key feauture of being benign or malignant.

## Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset**

Data Set Characteristics:

:Number of Instances: 569

:Number of Attributes: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

:Attribute Information:
    - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    - perimeter
    - area
    - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    - symmetry 
    - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

    The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
    largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
    resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
    13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

    - class:
            - WDBC-Malignant
            - WDBC-Benign

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.

The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
